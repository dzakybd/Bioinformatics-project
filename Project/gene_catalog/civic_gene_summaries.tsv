While crizontinib has demonstrated efficacy in treating the amplification, mutations in ALK have been shown to confer resistance to current tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Second-generation TKI's have seen varied success in treating these resistant cases, and the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG has been shown to be cytostatic in ALK-altered cell lines.2	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/2	AKT1	207	AKT1, also referred to as protein kinase B, is a known oncogene. AKT activation relies on the PI3K pathway, and is recognized as a critical node in the pathway. The E17 hotspot is the most characterized of AKT1 mutations, and has been shown to result in activation of the protein. Mutations in AKT1 have also been shown to confer resistance to allosteric kinase inhibitors in vitro.3	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/3	ARAF	369	ARAF has recently become increasingly considered for its oncogenic potential. Its potential as a target for informing clinical action was demonstrated by a single case of advanced lung adenocarcinoma harboring an S214C mutation that, when treated with sorafenib, acheived near-complete clinical remission. This finding has brought new focus on ARAF as a marker that should be assayed for in cancer treatment.4	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/4	ABL1	25	ABL1 is most relevant to cancer in its role in the BCR-ABL fusion protein that has become a signature of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Cells harboring this fusion have shown sensitivity to imatinib, greatly improving the prognostic outlook of the disease. However, additional mutations in ABL1 have been shown to confer resistance to imatinib. In these resistance cases, second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as dasatinib and nilotinib have exhibited some efficacy and are currently undergoing clinical trials for treating acquired resistance in CML.5	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5	BRAF	673	BRAF mutations are found to be recurrent in many cancer types. Of these, the mutation of valine 600 to glutamic acid (V600E) is the most prevalent. V600E has been determined to be an activating mutation, and cells that harbor it, along with other V600 mutations are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. It is also common to use MEK inhibition as a substitute for BRAF inhibitors, and the MEK inhibitor trametinib has seen some success in BRAF mutant melanomas. BRAF mutations have also been correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types, although there is at least one study that questions this conclusion in papillary thyroid cancer.6	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/6	BRCA1	672	BRCA1 mutations in the germline have become a hallmark for hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. Variants that have been demonstrated to reduce the function of the protein have been shown to increase the risk for these cancers, as well as prostate and pancreatic cancer. These findings have been the impetus for the increased popularity of genetic testing of healthy individuals to assess risk. Recent studies in ovarian cancer have also demonstrated that BRCA mutation status can predict treatment response. A number of trials assessing BRCA mutation status have shown an improved response to platinum agents, and more recently has led to the FDA-approval of PARP inhibitors for BRCA-positive ovarian cancers. These studies have resulted in the Society of Gynecologic Oncology to recommend germline BRCA testing in all patients with a diagnosis of ovarian cancer.7	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/7	BRCA2	675	BRCA1 mutations in the germline have become a hallmark for hereditary breast and ovarian cancers.

These studies have resulted in the Society of Gynecologic Oncology to recommend germline BRCA testing in all patients with a diagnosis of ovarian cancer.8	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/8	CCND1	595	Cyclin D has been shown in many cancer types to be misregulated. Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins, and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate, have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are misregulated are widely variable, ranging from genomic amplification to changes in promoter methylation. While Cyclin D2 has only been found to be significantly deregulated in glioma, Cyclin D1 seems to be a pan-cancer actor. Cyclin D misregulation has been shown to lead to poorer outcomes in a number of studies, but currently there are no FDA-approved targeted therapies.9	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/9	CCND2	894	Cyclin D has been shown in many cancer types to be misregulated. Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are misregulated are widely variable, ranging from genomic amplification to changes in promoter methylation. While Cyclin D2 has only been found to be significantly deregulated in glioma, Cyclin D1 in particular seems to be a pan-cancer actor. Cyclin D misregulation has been shown to lead to poorer outcomes in a number of studies, and currently there are no FDA-approved targeted therapies.10	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/10	CCND3	896	Cyclin D has been shown in many cancer types to be misregulated. Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are misregulated are widely variable, ranging from genomic amplification to changes in promoter methylation. Cyclin D3 loss has been reported in T-ALL, a seemingly unique trend when compared to the amplifcations and overexpressions of the other cyclin D's. In a mouse study, the targeted therapeutic palbociclib significantly increased the median survival of the cyclin D3 knockouts.11	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/11	CCNE1	898	Cyclin E, while currenly not as widely implicated as its cyclin D counterparts, has been implicated in various carcinomas, including breast, gastric, stomach and colorectal. High levels of cyclin E, either by gene amplification or overexpression, have been shown to lead to poorer prognosis in gastic carcinoma, and these measurements are correlated with later stage disease. In lung cancer, neoplastic cells with higher levels of the cyclin E/CDK2 complex are more radiosensitive than their more lowly expressed counterparts.12	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/12	CDK6	1021	CDK6, along with its partner CDK4, are key players in cell cycle progression. The complex has been implicated in a number of cancer types, and is the focus of therapeutic research and development. One targeted therapy for CDK inhibition is palbociclib, which may slow the growth of advanced stage breast cancers. It has also been shown, in mouse, that CDK inhibition may sensitize mutant PIK3CA tumors to PI3K inhibitors.13	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/13	CDK4	1019	CDK4, along with its partner CDK6, are key players in cell cycle progression. The complex has been implicated in a number of cancer types, and is the focus of therapeutic research and development. One targeted therapy for CDK inhibition is palbociclib, which may slow the growth of advanced stage breast cancers. It has also been shown, in mouse, that CDK inhibition may sensitize mutant PIK3CA tumors to PI3K inhibitors.14	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/14	CDKN2A	1029	CDKN2A loss has been shown to be a significant event in a number of cancer types. While no targeted therapeutic has been engaged in clinical trials, the prognostic impact has been studied by a number of meta-analyses. In majority of cases CDKN2A is inactivated by homozygous deletions. One of the mechanisms by which loss of CDKN2A can occur is by hypermethylation of the promoter region for the gene. However, the prognostic impact of promoter hypermethylation has been relatively ambiguous. Many studies have suggesting poorer prognostic outcome for patients with hypermethylation in colorectal, liver, and younger lung cancer patients. This being said, there is still research to be done before this becomes a widely-accepted prognostic indicator. Additionally, CDKN2A (p16) expression is a surrogate marker for HPV infection. As such, CDKN2A expression is prognostic in Oropharyngeal and probably also non-oropharyngeal head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.15	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/15	CEBPA	1050	'AML with mutated CEBPA' is a provisional entity in the WHO classification of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is recommended to be tested for in patients with AML. CEBPA mutations are particularly associated with cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). CEBPA is an intronless gene that is required for granulocyte formation in mice. N-terminal nonsense mutations result in a dominant negative C/EBP-alpha protein while C-terminal mutations reduce the DNA-binding potential of this transcription factor. CEBPA mutations are associated with a favorable prognosis, however, NPM1 and FLT3 mutations should also be assessed in CN-AML patients as concurrent mutations may have prognostic implications.17	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/17	PRKACA	5566	PRKACA has been studied in breast cancer and has been found to mediate resistance to HER2 targeted therapies. It has also been found to contain a mutation hotspot that contributes to neoplastic behavior in neuroendocrine cancers. In hepatocellular fibrolamellar carcinoma (FL-HCC), the fusion DNAJB1 to PRKACA is suggested to be a diagnostic marker for this rare subtype of HCC. In one study, this fusion was observed in 15/15 FL-HCC cases examined and functional studies found that the fusion retained kinase activity.18	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/18	DNMT3A	1788	DNMT3A is one of several epigenetic modifiers identified as recurrently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). DNMT3A mutations are associated with cytogenetically normal AML. In vitro experiments indicate that the R882H mutation acts in a dominant negative manner to disrupt the de novo methyltransferase activity of wildtype homotetramers. AML patient bone marrow harboring R882 mutations were similarly demonstrated to be hypomethylated compared to patients with wildtype DNMT3A. These studies also indicated that non-R882 DNMT3A mutations may act in a functionally distinct manner from R882 mutations. Alternative mechanisms indicate independent prognostic outcomes and treatment protocols may need to be considered for these two classes of DNMT3A mutations.19	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/19	EGFR	1956	EGFR is widely recognized for its importance in cancer. Amplification and mutations have been shown to be driving events in many cancer types. Its role in non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma and basal-like breast cancers has spurred many research and drug development efforts. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown efficacy in EGFR amplfied tumors, most notably gefitinib and erlotinib. Mutations in EGFR have been shown to confer resistance to these drugs, particularly the variant T790M, which has been functionally characterized as a resistance marker for both of these drugs. The later generation TKI's have seen some success in treating these resistant cases, and targeted sequencing of the EGFR locus has become a common practice in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.  Overproduction of ligands is another possible mechanism of activation of EGFR. ERBB ligands include EGF, TGF-a, AREG, EPG, BTC, HB-EGF, EPR and NRG1-4 (for detailed information please refer to the respective ligand section). In ligand-activated cancers, Cetuximab appears to be more effective than tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (Arteaga et. al.).20	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/20	ERBB2	2064	ERBB2, commonly referred to as HER2, is amplified and/or overexpressed in 20-30% of invasive breast carcinomas. HER2-positive breast cancer is treated in a separate manner from other subtypes of breast cancer and commonly presents as more aggressive disease. Metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer is now commonly treated with HER2-targeted therapy. Apart from being amplified/overexpressed, ERBB2 activating mutations have been shown to have clinical importance in HER2-negative breast cancer. These mutations have shown sensitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor neratinib, and highlight the importance of clinical sequencing efforts in treating breast cancer.21	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/21	ESR1	2099	ESR1 has been a focus in breast cancer for quite some time, but is also clinically relevant in endometrial, ovarian and other cancer types. The identification of ER-positive breast cancers that are resistant to hormone therapy have inspired clinical sequencing efforts to shed light on the mechanisms of this resistance. A number of mutations in the ligand binding domain of ESR1 have been implicated in hormone resistance and anti-estrogen therapies. These observations have spurred efforts to develop therapeutics that stimulate ESR1 protein degradation (e.g. Fulvestrant), rather than acting as a small molecule antagonist. These agents are currently in clinical trials and have seen some success.22	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/22	FGFR2	2263	The FGFR proteins are involved in a wide array of pathways known to play a signficant role in cancer. Activation of these receptors can lead to activation of the RAS-MAPK pathway and the PI3K-AKT pathway, among others. The mechanisms by which FGFR can be misregulated vary between cancers. Amplification of the receptors has been observed in lung and breast cancers, coding mutations and deletions have been seen in many cancers, and more recently, FGFR fusions that lead to pathway actiation have been demonstrated to have oncogenic potential across multiple cancer types. The targeted therapeutics ponatinib, dovitinib and pazopanib have seen success in treating over-active FGFR signalling, prompting use of diagnostic sequencing targeting the FGFR genes, especially in lung cancer patients.23	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/23	FGFR3	2261	The FGFR proteins are involved in a wide array of pathways known to play a signficant role in cancer. Activation of these receptors can lead to activation of the RAS-MAPK pathway and the PI3K-AKT pathway, among others. The mechanisms by which FGFR can be misregulated vary between cancers. Amplification of the receptors has been observed in lung and breast cancers, coding mutations and deletions have been seen in many cancers, and more recently, FGFR fusions that lead to pathway actiation have been demonstrated to have oncogenic potential across multiple cancer types. The targeted therapeutics ponatinib, dovitinib and pazopanib have seen success in treating over-active FGFR signalling, prompting use of diagnostic sequencing targeting the FGFR genes, especially in lung cancer patients.24	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/24	FLT3	2322	FLT3 is an important cytokine receptor involved in normal hematopoiesis. Mutations in this gene are common in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and screening for mutations in this gene has been recommended by the World Health Organization in patients with AML, particularly in cases of cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). FLT3 mutations commonly co-occur with mutations such as NPM1 that are associated with CN-AML and likely modulate prognostic impact. While FLT3-ITD mutations have been associated with poorer prognosis in AML, the prognostic impact of FLT3-TKD mutations are still up for debate.25	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/25	GATA2	2624	GATA2 is a transcription factor involved in stem cell maintenance with key roles in hematopoietic development. GATA2 mutations are associated with a variety of inherited and acquired immune disorders including myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. In addition to a role in hematopoiesis, the maintenance GATA2 expression has been implicated as a requirement in KRAS-driven non-small cell lung cancer. Preclinical models have indicated therapeutic benefit from targeting GATA2-mediated pathways in the context of KRAS-driven NSCLC.26	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/26	IDH1	3417	IDH1 mutations have been observed in a number of cancer types, including sarcomas, hematologic malignancies, colon cancer and brain cancer. Mutations in the two isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes involved in cytoplasmic (IDH1) and mitochondrial (IDH2) conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to D-2-hydroxyglutarate have been described as mutually exclusive in many of these cancer types. The most frequent mutations involve R132 (IDH1) and R172 (IDH2) involve the active site and result in neomorphic enzyme activity. The implications of mutations in this gene vary greatly by cancer type. In myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IDH1 mutations have been associated with worse outcome, shorter overall survival, and normal karyotype. However, in glioblastoma and astrocytoma, patients with IDH1 mutations have shown better overall survival than patients with wild-type IDH1. Unlike the association with cytogenetically normal AML, in glioblastoma, IDH1 mutations have been associated with specific cytogenetic abnormalities, 1p and 19q deletions.27	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/27	IDH2	3418	IDH2 mutations have been observed in a number of cancer types, including sarcomas, hematologic malignancies, colon cancer and brain cancer. Mutations in the two isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes involved in cytoplasmic (IDH1) and mitochondrial (IDH2) conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to D-2-hydroxyglutarate have been described as mutually exclusive in many of these cancer types. The most frequent mutations involve R132 (IDH1) and R172 (IDH2) involve the active site and result in neomorphic enzyme activity. Although IDH2 (R172) mutations are associated with poorer overall prognosis in AML patients, its utility as a prognostic marker in MDS is still under debate. Additionally, IDH2 (R140) has been associated with improved overall survival in AML. IDH2 mutations have been associated with improved prognosis in gliomas.28	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/28	JAK2	3717	JAK2 is a kinase that is misregulated or mutated in a number of myeloproliferative diseases and cancers. The mutation V617F is the most clinically relevant variant, and is seen in around half of myeloproliferative disorders. The variant is a known activating mutation, and activated JAK2 is sufficient to drive myeloproliferative disorders in mouse models. V617F, while most recurrent, is not the only mechanism by which JAK2 can be activated in patients. JAK2 is now one of the first diagnostic markers tested upon diagnosis with a myeloproliferative disorder.29	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/29	KIT	3815	c-KIT activation has been shown to have oncogenic activity in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), melanomas, lung cancer, and other tumor types. The targeted therapeutics nilotinib and sunitinib have shown efficacy in treating KIT overactive patients, and are in late-stage trials in melanoma and GIST. KIT overactivity can be the result of many genomic events from genomic amplification to overexpression to missense mutations. Missense mutations have been shown to be key players in mediating clinical response and acquired resistance in patients being treated with these targeted therapeutics.30	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/30	KRAS	3845	Mutations in the RAS family of proteins are frequently observed across cancer types. The amino acid positions that account for the overwhelming majority of these mutations are G12, G13 and Q61. The different protein isoforms, despite their raw similarity, also behave very differently when expressed in non-native tissue types, likely due to differences in the C-terminal hyper-variable regions. Mis-regulation of isoform expression has been shown to be a driving event in cancer, as well as missense mutations at the three hotspots previously mentioned. While highly recurrent in cancer, attempts to target these RAS mutants with inhibitors have not been successful, and has not yet become common practice in the clinic. The prognostic implications for KRAS mutations vary between cancer types, but have been shown to be associated with poor outcome in colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and others.31	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/31	MAP2K1	5604	MAP2K1 is a dual-specificity kinase known for it's involvement in the ERK pathway by activation of ERK1 and ERK2. MAP2K1 activating mutations have been observed in a number of cancers including ovarian,  melanoma and lung. These activating mutations are generally found in the N-terminal negative regulatory region or the ATP-binding region of the N-terminal lobe.  Inhibitors of MEK genes have been shown to inhibit tumor growth in these cases.33	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/33	CSF1R	1436	34	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/34	MGMT	4255	35	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/35	NPM1	4869	AML with mutated NPM1 is a provisional entity in the WHO classification of AML and is recommended to be tested in patients with cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). FLT3 mutations should be evaluated concurrently as they have prognostic consequences. NPM1 mutations are concentrated in exon 12, most frequently W288fs which results in cytoplasmic sequestration of the protein. Exon 12 NPM1 mutations in the absence of FLT3-ITD are associated with good prognostic outcomes. Mice expressing the Npm1-W288fs mutation develop myeloproliferative neoplasms but not overt leukemia, indicating it may require additional mutations to promote leukemic development.36	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/36	NRAS	4893	Mutations in the RAS family of proteins have frequently been observed across cancer types. The amino acid positions G12, G13 and Q61 account for the overwhelming majority of these mutations. The isoforms, despite their raw similarity, also behave very differently when expressed in non-native tissue types, likely due to differences in the C-terminal hyper-variable regions. Mis-regulation of isoform expression has been shown to be a driving event in cancer, as well as missense mutations at the three hotspots previously mentioned. While highly recurrent in cancer, targeting these RAS mutants has also been very elusive, and has not yet become common practice in the clinic.37	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/37	PIK3CA	5290	PIK3CA is the most recurrently mutated gene in breast cancer, and has been found to important in a number of cancer types. An integral part of the PI3K pathway, PIK3CA has long been described as an oncogene, with two main hotspots for activating mutations, the 542/545 region of the helical domain, and the 1047 region of the kinase domain. PIK3CA, and its interaction with the AKT and mTOR pathways, is the subject of an immense amount of research and development, and PI3K inhibition has seen some limited success in recent clinical trials. While monotherapies seem to be limited in their potential, there is a recent interest in pursuing PI3K inhibition as part of a combination therapy regiment with inhibition partners including TKI's, MEK inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, and in breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors.38	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/38	PDGFRA	5156	Commonly mutated in GI tract tumors, PDGFR family genes (mutually exclusive to KIT mutations) are a hallmark of gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Gene fusions involving the PDGFRA kinase domain are highly correlated with eosinophilia, and the WHO classifies myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with these characteristics as a distinct disorder. Mutations in the 842 region of PDGFRA have been often found to confer resistance to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib.39	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/39	PML	5371	The PML-RARA fusion is the result of a recurrent, balanced translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17, denoted as t(15;17)(q22;q12), and a diagnostic event in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown sensitivity to ATRA (all-trans retinoic acid) in APL patients harboring the PML-RARA fusion. Recent interest has been shown in combining ATRA and arsenic trioxide for treating these patients, and early results seem promising. Though point mutations in the B2 domain of PML may confer resistance to ATRA in these patients.41	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/41	PTEN	5728	PTEN is a multi-functional tumor suppressor that is very commonly lost in human cancer. Observed in prostate cancer, glioblastoma, endometrial, lung and breast cancer to varying degrees. Up to 70% of prostate cancer patients have been observed to have loss of expression of the gene. It is a part of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and mTOR inhibitors have been relatively ineffective in treating patients with PTEN loss. New appoaches using microRNAs are currently being investigated.42	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/42	RET	5979	RET mutations and the RET fusion RET-PTC lead to activation of this tyrosine kinase receptor and are associated with thyroid cancers. RET point mutations are the most common mutations identified in medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) with germline and somatic mutations in RET associated with hereditary and sporadic forms, respectively. The most common somatic form mutation is M918T (exon 16) and a variety of other mutations effecting exons 10, 11 and 15 have been described. The prognostic significance of these mutations have been hotly debated in the field, however, data suggests that some RET mutation may confer drug resistence. No RET-specific agents are currently clinically available but several promiscuous kinase inhibitors that target RET, among others, have been approved for MTC treatment.43	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/43	RUNX1	861	RUNX1 is a transcription factor that forms a complex with the cofactor CBFB. This complex provides stability to the RUNX1 protein which is involved in the generation of hematopoietic stem cells and for their differentiation into myeloid and lymphoid lines.  Loss of RUNX1 function has been shown to impair differentiation between myeloid and lymphoid lines often resulting in the development of leukemia.44	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/44	SF3B1	23451	SF3B1 mutations have been described in several myeloid malignancies, predominantly myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), as well as other hematologic malignancies, breast cancer, and uveal melanoma (UM). SF3B1 is one of several genes involved in RNA splicing that has been identified as recurrently mutated in MDS and other malignanices. The mutations affecting SF3B1 are typically heterozygous, point mutations suspected to be functionally deleterious with R625 and K700E described as a major mutation hotspots. MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations have been reported to have better overall and event-free survival than their wildtype counterparts. Additionally, these mutations are highly associated with subtypes of MDS characterized by ringed sideroblasts (refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ring sideroblasts). In UM patients, SF3B1 mutations have been reported to be associated with chromosome 3 disomy, which defines a subgroup with low risk of metastasis.45	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/45	TP53	7157	TP53 mutations are universal across cancer types. The loss of a tumor suppressor is most often through large deleterious events, such as frameshift mutations, or premature stop codons. In TP53 however, many of the observed mutations in cancer are found to be single nucleotide missense variants. These variants are broadly distributed throughout the gene, but with the majority localizing in the DNA binding domain. There is no single hotspot in the DNA binding domain, but a majority of mutations occur in amino acid positions 175, 245, 248, 273, and 282 (NM_000546) (Olivier et al., 2010). To fulfill its proper biological function four TP53 polypeptides must form a tetramer which functions as a transcription factor, therefore even if one out of four polypeptides has inactivating mutation it may lead to dominant negative phenotype of variable degree. While a large proportion of cancer genomics research is focused on somatic variants, TP53 is also of note in the germline. Germline TP53 mutations are the hallmark of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and many (both germline and somatic) variants have been found to have a prognostic impact on patient outcomes. The significance of many polymorphisms for susceptibility and prognosis of disease is still very much up for debate.46	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/46	TSC1	7248	47	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/47	TSC2	7249	48	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/48	U2AF1	7307	U2AF1 is one of several spliceosome complex genes frequently mutated in a variety of hematologic malignancies, particularly de novo myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), as well as solid tumors such as lung and pancreatic cancers. Two hotspot mutations (S34 and Q157) occur within the two zinc-finger domains of the U2AF1 protein. These mutations have been associated with altered splicing patterns in vitro and in vivo. U2AF1 mutations in MDS have been associated with an increased risk of transformation to secondary acute myeloid leukemia, however, the impact of these mutations on overall survival has been an area of debate.49	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/49	WT1	7490	WT1 is a tumor suppressor gene associated with the development of Wilms' Tumor, from which it was named. Mutations in exon 7 and 9 of WT1 have been recurrently identified in acute myeloid leukemia and associated with poorer prognosis and chemotherapy resistance.50	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/50	NOTCH1	4851	NOTCH1 is one of four known genes encoding the NOTCH family of proteins, a group of receptors involved in the Notch signaling pathway. NOTCH proteins are characterized by N-terminal EGF-like repeats followed by LNR domains which form a complex with ligands to prevent signaling. The Notch signaling pathway is involved in processes related to cell fate specification, differentiation, proliferation, and survival. Activation of Notch has been shown to be correlative with mammary tumorgenesis in mice and increased expression of Notch receptors has been observed in a variety of cancer types including cervical, colon, head and neck, lung, renal, pancreatic, leukemia, and breast cancer. A number of treatment modalities have been explored related to Notch inhibition especially in breast cancer with mixed results.51	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/51	DDR2	4921	52	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/52	MET	4233	Mesenchymal Epithelial Transition MET is a prototypical receptor tyrosine kinase. Its ligand is Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF). MET alterations are drivers of human cancer.  Amplification and resulting overexpression has been reported in several cancers, and make the receptor's activity independent of HGF. Gene fusions also decouple kinase activity from the cell membrane and render it constitutively active.  Finally, exclusion of the juxtamembrane (JM) domain of the kinase by skipping of exon 14 activates the kinase.53	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/53	FLI1	2313	54	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/54	EWSR1	2130	Fusions between EWSR1 and multiple 3` partners are regularly identified in soft tissue sarcomas and can aid in differential diagnosis. The fusion product usually contains the N-terminal transcription-activating domain of EWSR1 and the C-terminal DNA-binding domain of the fusion partner, generating a novel transcription factor.55	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/55	TET2	54790	56	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/56	FOXP1	27086	57	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/57	REL	5966	58	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/58	VHL	7428	Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is characterized by heterozygous germline mutation in VHL gene on chromosome 3p. Patients are predisposed to developing hemangioblastomas of the brain, spinal cord, and retina; renal cysts and clear cell renal cell carcinoma; pheochromocytoma, pancreatic cysts and neuroendocrine tumors; endolymphatic sac tumors; and epididymal and broad ligament cysts. Cerebellar hemangioblastomas may be associated with headache, vomiting, gait disturbances, or ataxia. Spinal hemangioblastomas and related syrinx usually present with pain. Sensory and motor loss may develop with cord compression. Retinal hemangioblastomas may be the initial manifestation of VHL disease and can cause vision loss. Renal cell carcinoma occurs in about 70% of individuals with VHL and is the leading cause of mortality. Pheochromocytomas can be asymptomatic but may cause sustained or episodic hypertension. Pancreatic lesions often remain asymptomatic and rarely cause endocrine or exocrine insufficiency. Endolymphatic sac tumors can cause hearing loss of varying severity, which can be a presenting symptom. Cystadenomas of the epididymis are relatively common. They rarely cause problems, unless bilateral, in which case they may result in infertility.  The VHL gene product encodes pVHL, which binds to elongin C, elongin B, cullin-2 and Rbx1. This complex catalyzes the polyubiquitinylation of specific proteins and targets them for degradation by proteosomes. For example, under normoxic conditions, hydroxylated hypoxia-inducble factor alpha subunits (HIF��) binds pVHL targets HIF�� for degradation. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF1�� is not hydroxylated, pVHL does not bind, and HIF1�� subunits accumulate. HIF1�� forms heterodimers with HIF1�_ and activates transcription of a variety of hypoxia-inducible genes (i.e., VEGF, EPO, TGF��, PDGF�_). Likewise, when pVHL is absent or mutated, HIF1�� subunits accumulate, resulting in cell proliferation and the neovascularization of tumors characteristic of VHL disease.  Pathogenic variants in VHL either prevent its expression (i.e., deletions, frameshifts, nonsense mutations, and splice site mutations) or lead to the expression of an abnormal protein (i.e., missense mutations). Missense mutations that destabilize packing of the alpha-helical domains, decrease the stability of the alpha-beta domain interface, interfere with binding of elongin C and HIF1��, or disrupt hydrophobic core residues result in loss of HIF regulation and are more likely to result in VHL type 1 (no predisposition to pheochromocytoma).  Missense mutations that result in pVHL that is normal with respect to HIF regulation are more likely to be associated with VHL with clinical pheochromocytoma.   Acquired somatic pathogenic variants in VHL may give rise to sporadic VHL-type tumors (i.e., clear cell RCC and hemangioblastoma) without other associated tumors characteristic of the hereditary disease. It should be noted that >90% of the most common form of kidney cancer (clear cell renal cell carcinoma) are associated with bi-allelic somatic mutation in the VHL gene, and is the rationale for the anti-angiogenic therapy for RCC patients.59	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/59	BCL2	596	60	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/60	IGF2	3481	61	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/61	AURKA	6790	62	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/62	PBRM1	55193	63	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/63	EZH2	2146	64	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/64	KMT2D	8085	65	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/65	BTK	695	66	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/66	APC	324	67	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/67	AR	367	68	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/68	ASXL1	171023	69	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/69	ATM	472	ATM is a DNA-damage response gene that is commonly mutated in cancer.

It has been observed to be expressed during embryonic development however expression attenuates after development in all but a few tissues. Research has indicated that over-expression of PAX proteins in general are not an initiating event in tumorgenesis however they may facilitate malignant development. PAX8 is expressed in 80-96% of all High-grade serous carcinomas (HGSC) and is commonly used as a marker for the disease. In addition PAX8 has become a useful biomarker for differentiating between mullerian mucinous and non-mullerian tumors.

Ligands include EGF, epiregulin, betacellulin and the neuregulins (Sundvall et. al.). Of these, NRG3 and NRG4 exclusively bind HER4 (Hynes et. al.).  Mutations in ERBB4 have been identified in various cancer types including melanoma, lung adenocarcinoma and medulloblastoma.

The TFIIH complex is known to be involved in the nucleotide excision repair pathway (NER) which can repair DNA damage caused by chemotherapeutic treatment and basal transcription. ERCC2 variants have been observed in a variety of cancers. A number of studies have suggested ERCC2 variants can act as biomarkers to predict response to neoadjuvant treatment, and cancer prognosis. Additionally the Lys751Gln polymorphism has been observed to increase risk in a number of cancer types; however, results have been conflicting.1737	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1737	EREG	2069	1741	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1741	ERCC5	2073	1763	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1763	ETS2	2114	1764	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1764	ETV1	2115	1767	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1767	ETV4	2118	1768	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1768	ETV5	2119	1769	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1769	ETV6	2120	1810	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1810	FANCA	2175	1811	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1811	FANCC	2176	1842	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1842	FCGR2A	2212	1843	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1843	FCGR2B	2213	1844	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1844	FCGR3A	2214	1872	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1872	FGF2	2247	1873	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1873	FGF3	2248	FGF3 is a member of the basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) gene family and was first identified  based on it's similarity to the mouse proto-oncogene int-2. Amplifications of this gene and the surrounding region (11q13) have been observed in various cancers including breast cancer, esophogeal cancer, melanoma, bladder cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Lower tumor grade and stage have been associated with FGF3 amplifications in HCC; however, this event is fairly rare in this tumor type.1883	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1883	FGF13	2258	1885	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1885	FGFR1	2260	FGFR1 is a member of the Fibroblast Growth Factor family, comprising of 4 receptors and 18 Ligands.  FGFR1 signalling downstream functions mainly via PI3K and MAPK pathways (Turner et. al.). Several ways of involvement of FGFR1 in cancer have been proposed: auto- and paracrine activation, amplification and overexpression (Marshall et. al,  Weiss et. al.,  Cheng et. al.). Especially amplification of FGFR1 in lung cancer is an emerging treatment target with clinical studies currently ongoing (e.g. NCT01004224). However, FGFR1 amplification does not always correlate with protein expression and predictive biomarkers still remain to be defined in clinic (von M�_ssenhausen et. al.). Mutation of FGFR1 seems to be less common, but has been described in glioblastoma, pilocytic astrocytomas and Ewing's sarcoma (Rand et. al., Jones et. al., Agelopoulos et. al.).1887	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1887	FGFR4	2264	1938	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1938	FLT4	2324	1950	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1950	FNTB	2342	1955	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1955	FOS	2353	2073	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/2073	MTOR	2475	mTOR deregulation has been observed in many cancer types.

The resulting fusion protein harbors the constitutively active ROS1 kinase domain and drives cellular proliferation (Davies et. al.). In NSCLC about 1% harbor a ROS1 rearrangement. These patients are predominantely female and have a lower T-stage (Warth et. al.). Treatment with crizotinib leads to a reported objective response rate of appr. 70% and a median duration of response of 18 months (Shaw et. al.). Resistance mechanisms to crizotinib have been described and involve mutations in the kinase domain. More selective inhibitors of ROS1 might overcome this resistance (Davare et. al.).5013	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5013	RPS6	6194	5051	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5051	RRM1	6240	5052	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5052	RRM2	6241	5128	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5128	SCN8A	6334	5167	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5167	CX3CL1	6376	5177	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5177	SDHB	6390	5210	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5210	SRSF2	6427	5225	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5225	SGK1	6446	5356	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5356	SMARCB1	6598	5365	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5365	SMO	6608	5418	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5418	SOX10	6663	5500	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5500	SSX1	6756	5501	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5501	SSX2	6757	5503	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5503	SSX4	6759	5516	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5516	STAT3	6774	5525	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5525	SULT1E1	6783	5534	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5534	STK11	6794	5572	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5572	SYK	6850	5649	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5649	ZEB1	6935	5731	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5731	NR2F2	7026	5737	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5737	TFF3	7033	5742	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5742	TGFA	7039	5761	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5761	THBS2	7058	5777	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5777	TIMP1	7076	5813	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5813	TMPRSS2	7113	5845	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5845	TOP1	7150	5848	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5848	TOP2A	7153	5870	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5870	TPT1	7178	5939	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5939	TSPYL1	7259	5971	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5971	TYMS	7298	6023	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/6023	UGT1A	7361	6071	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/6071	VEGFA	7422	6104	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/6104	WEE1	7465	6144	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/6144	XRCC1	7515	6329	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/6329	CXCR4	7852	6538	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/6538	KDM5C	8242	6559	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/6559	ARID1A	8289	6906	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/6906	ABCC3	8714	7009	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/7009	CFLAR	8837	7014	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/7014	PROM1	8842	7024	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/7024	ALDH1A2	8854	7041	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/7041	SPHK1	8877	7297	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/7297	PTTG1	9232	7451	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/7451	ABCG2	9429	7502	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/7502	KIF23	9493	7936	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/7936	AKT3	10000	7953	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/7953	BCL2L11	10018	7954	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/7954	SH2B3	10019	8032	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/8032	RAD50	10111	8160	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/8160	SPRY2	10253	8262	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/8262	TUBB3	10381	8292	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/8292	YAP1	10413	8331	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/8331	MERTK	10461	8351	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/8351	HOXB13	10481	8407	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/8407	AGR2	10551	8450	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/8450	SLCO1B1	10599	8524	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/8524	DLL3	10683	8552	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/8552	STAG3	10734	8553	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/8553	STAG2	10735	8614	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/8614	HSPH1	10808	8787	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/8787	TLK2	11011	8878	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/8878	PTPRT	11122	8908	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/8908	PTP4A3	11156	8950	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/8950	CHEK2	11200	9171	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/9171	DKK1	22943	9189	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/9189	NT5C2	22978	This

The interaction of PD1/PDL1 is hypothesized to be a possible mechanism for the tumor to escape immune response. A number of checkpoint blockade inhibitors including pembrolizumab and nivolumab have been developed that target the PD1/PDL1 interaction in order to allow T-cells to recognize tumor cells without being deactivated by the tumor.11492	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/11492	CTAG2	30848	11587	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/11587	FOXP3	50943	11761	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/11761	CRBN	51185	11932	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/11932	DDX41	51428	12074	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/12074	SUFU	51684	12112	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/12112	CDK12	51755	12121	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/12121	RSF1	51773	12146	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/12146	LRP1B	53353	LRP1B is a putative tumor suppressor and a member of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family.

Overexpression of Livin has been observed in a variety of cancers including lung, colon, and prostate compared to most normal adult tissues and has been proposed as a putative therapeutic target.15013	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/15013	PALB2	79728	15344	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/15344	PREX2	80243	15403	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/15403	PDCD1LG2	80380	16394	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/16394	HAVCR2	84868	16656	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/16656	ABCC10	89845	16872	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/16872	SLFN11	91607	17016	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/17016	NAPRT	93100	18353	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/18353	VPS37A	137492	18364	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/18364	PXDNL	137902	18420	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/18420	AMER1	139285	19959	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/19959	FLCN	201163	20480	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/20480	RICTOR	253260	22231	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/22231	ATXN1L	342371	24938	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/24938	MIR218-1	407000	26599	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/26599	ECSCR	641700	32083	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/32083	KLLN	100144748	34321	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/34321	DUX4	100288687
